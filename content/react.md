## Before <Tag value='62 h' />

My React journey started in July 2020. There're some special times spent:

- The first encounter with React - the official tutorial and onboarding pratice at my first job, took approximately 20 h
- [A Complete Guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/) by Dan Abramov - 5 h
- [Deconstructing React](https://youtu.be/eTcyOCd6v1c?si=Zis_VAl1pgEWdZhj) by Tejas Kumar - 3 h
- [Build your own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) by Rodrigo Pombo. I followed this article to build [my own React](https://github.com/yuleicul/build-your-own/tree/main/react) for about 10 h.
- [React mentoring program 2022](https://github.com/yuleicul/react-mentoring-program-2022) with my colleague Addy Zhou, where I learned Redux for the first time. - 24 h
