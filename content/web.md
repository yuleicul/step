- "Do note that for signed tokens this information, though protected against tampering, is readable by anyone. Do not put secret information in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is encrypted."

- "If the token is sent in the Authorization header, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) won't be an issue as it doesn't use cookies."

- "When your authentication server receives an incoming JWT, it uses the incoming JWT's header and payload segments and the shared private key to generate a signature. If the signature matches, then your application knows that the incoming JWT can be trusted."
