I saw a table on a [website](https://www.ieltsanswers.com/much-studying-get-score.html):

| Hours of Studying | IELTS grade |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 1000 - 1200 hours | 7.5+        |
| 700 - 800 hours   | 6.5 - 7.0   |

Because I got 6.5 in my latest IELTS test, I estimate that I have spent 700 hours on English until March 1, 2024.
