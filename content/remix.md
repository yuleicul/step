> The `build/server` directory created by `remix vite:build` is just a module that you run inside a server like Express, Cloudflare Workers, Netlify, Vercel, Fastly, AWS, Deno, Azure, Fastify, Firebase, ... anywhere.
>
> Instead of stopping, rebuilding, and starting your server all the time, you can run Remix in development using **Vite in middleware mode**. This enables instant feedback to changes in your app with React Refresh (Hot Module Replacement) and Remix Hot Data Revalidation.
>
> Remix compiles your app into two things:
>
> - A request handler that you add to your own JavaScript server
> - A pile of static assets in your public directory for the browser
>
> You can bring your own server with adapters to deploy anywhere
> You can set up a development workflow with HMR built-in
