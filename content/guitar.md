(This paragraph is translated by ChatGPT) The first time I learned to play the guitar was in a guitar shop near the agricultural market in my hometown. I didn't stay there for long, and then I switched to another one that was in a small alley selling potatoes at a crossroads. The interior of this shop resembled a bar. It was also there that I had a bicycle stolen. Later, I went to Guiyang for high school and secretly saved 800 from my monthly living expenses to learn fingerstyle guitar at a place not far from the school. There, I learned to play Kotaro Oshio's first song. Later still, I went to Shanghai for university and enrolled in a four-person small group class at Muyin-Tang. It was there that I formally began to systematically learn fingerstyle. However, good days didn't last long, as the pandemic came soon after.
