::: details

### Identify cloud services

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Just bare computers (without operating systems). **Azure Virtual Machines is IaaS**.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Hosted platform in the cloud. Not only infrastructure, but also specialized software from the cloud provider, like operating systems. **Azure App Service is PaaS**.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): software or service hosted in the cloud, e.g. Outlook, Gmail, Netflix, etc

### Azure geographies and regions

Countries + Compliance = Geographies

Geographies + Datacenters = regions

> 3D visualized datacenter: https://bit.ly/gsma-datacenter

E.g. _West US_ is a region, and _US_ is a geography

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

ARM uses **templates** to deploy Azure resources. No matter how you interact with Azure or manage your resources, ARM is always going to be doing the work under the hood.

> I guess ARM template is like `netlify.toml` which is used by Netlify to deploy your application.

### Azure Blob Storage

- Storing unstructured data
- Organized in _containers_
- _Blob_ is a file-like object of immutable, raw data.
- Tiers: hot, cool, and archive
