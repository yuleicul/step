- [Register a single-page application in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-spa)

  OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow (with PKCE) allows the application to exchange an authorization code for **ID tokens to represent the authenticated user and Access tokens needed to call protected APIs**. In addition, it returns **Refresh tokens** that provide long-term access to resources on behalf of users without requiring interaction with those users.

  The implicit grant flow allows the application to get ID and Access tokens. Unlike the authorization code flow, **implicit grant flow doesn't return a Refresh token**.

  1.  Create signing key and encryption key under _Identity Experience Framework_ - _Policy Keys_.
  2.  Register two applications that it uses to sign up and sign in users with local accounts: **IdentityExperienceFramework**, a web API, and **ProxyIdentityExperienceFramework**, a native app with delegated permission to the IdentityExperienceFramework app.
  3.  Download policy starter pack and update values of `yourtenant`, `IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId`, and `ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId`.
  4.  Upload policy files in correct order.
  5.  Test with **B2C_1A_signup_signin**. Unfortunately, I got an error:
      ![b2c login error](/b2c-error.png)
      The problem is that I should have used files inside `/Display Controls Starterpack`, instead of files under the root.

  1.  Prerequisites: the B2C Users need to have an authentication method specified for self-service password reset. Select the B2C User, in the left menu under _Manage_, select _Authentication methods_, ensure _Authentication contact info_ is set. B2C users created via a SignUp flow will have this set by default. For users created via Azure Portal or by Graph API need to have this set for SSPR to work.

  - `redirectUri` should be configured in Azure Portal application authentication. Be careful choose single-page application for type.
  - All parts of the app that require authentication must be wrapped in the `MsalProvider` component.
  - `useMsal` hook can give us an `instance`, and we can do `loginPopup`, `loginRedirect`, `logoutPopup`, and `logoutRedirect` with it. We can also call `instance.acquireTokenSilent` to get the tokens (`access_token`, `id_token`, `client_info`, `refresh_token`, etc), and use `access_token` to call Microsoft API (e.g Graph API).
  - `useIsAuthenticated` hook gives us a boolean value whether or not a user is currently signed-in.

- [msal-react/docs/getting-started.md](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-react/docs/getting-started.md):

  - Components `AuthenticatedTemplate` and `UnauthenticatedTemplate` can do the same thing as `useIsAuthenticated` hook does.
  - Components `MsalAuthenticationTemplate` and `useMsalAuthentication` hook can do the same thing as `instance` does.
  - Besides of `instance`, `useMsal` gives us `accounts` for an array of all accounts currently signed in, and an `inProgress` that tells you what msal is currently doing.
  - They recommend that the app calls the `acquireTokenSilent` API on the PublicClientApplication object each time you need an access token to access an API.

Q: what's the difference between various tokens?

- [ ] This version of the library uses the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. To read more about this protocol, as well as the differences between implicit flow and authorization code flow, see the section in the @azure/msal-browser readme.

  _Client_ = _Application_

  Confidential Clients can keep a secret, and Public Clients can't. Simply put, Confidential Clients are server-side applications (written in Node, Java, etc.), while Public Clients are client-side applications (written in JavaScript, etc).

  _PKCE_ (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is an extension to OAuth developed specifically for doing OAuth in **Public Clients**.

- Identify cloud services

  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Just bare computers (without operating systems). **Azure Virtual Machines is IaaS**.
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS): Hosted platform in the cloud. Not only infrastructure, but also specialized software from the cloud provider, like operating systems. **Azure App Service is PaaS**.
  - Software as a Service (SaaS): software or service hosted in the cloud, e.g. Outlook, Gmail, Netflix, etc

- Azure geographies and regions

  Geographies + Datacenters = regions

- Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

  ARM uses **templates** to deploy Azure resources. No matter how you interact with Azure or manage your resources, ARM is always going to be doing the work under the hood.

  > I guess ARM template is like `netlify.toml` which is used by Netlify to deploy your application.
